                            As anyone who has spent time with cats knows, our feline 
                            companions are mysterious—much more so than those other 
                            furry family members. Here John Bradshaw, author of Cat 
                            Sense (Basic Books, 2013), fields a selection of questions 
                            submitted by Scientific American editors and Twitter followers 
                            about the cat’s many quirks. Bradshaw is a visiting fellow at 
                            the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences in 
                            England, where he studies the behavior and welfare of cats and d
                            ogs, as well as their interactions with people.
